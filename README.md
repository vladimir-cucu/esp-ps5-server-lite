# ESP8266 PlayStation 5 Web Exploit Server

Lightweight web server for ESP8266 boards that hosts the [PlayStation 5 UMTX2 Jailbreak](https://github.com/idlesauce/umtx2) for firmware versions 1.00â€“5.50, with minor modifications to enable caching. The following payloads are currently preloaded: [etaHEN v2.1b](https://github.com/etaHEN/etaHEN/releases/tag/2.1B), [byepervisor](https://github.com/PS5Dev/Byepervisor) and [elfldr](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/elfldr).

## Quick Setup Guide

### Access Point Details

- SSID: `PS5_WEB_AP`
- Password: `password`

### Accessing the Exploit Page from User's Guide

You will need to use `v1.10` of the precompiled `.bin` file. Starting from `v1.11`, the User's Guide won't redirect to the exploit page. This is because an additional DNS Server and HTTPS Server is required for this feature to work, which makes the ESP8266 slow to provide the initial connection to your PS5 and the WiFi has connection issues when using an FTP server.

I recommend you download and install [ESP Host FPKG](https://www.mediafire.com/file/w4e6hiuwfoj8dnb/esphost.zip) after successfully jailbreaking your console. Use it to open the cached exploit page in the future. All precompiled `.bin` files work with ESP Host FKPG.

### Accessing the Exploit Page from ESP Host FPKG

The exploit is served at `http://10.1.1.1/index.html`, thus, you can use [ESP Host FPKG](https://www.mediafire.com/file/w4e6hiuwfoj8dnb/esphost.zip) to open the cached explotit page.

### Flashing Ready-To-Use `.bin` File

A ready-to-use `.bin` file can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/vladimir-cucu/esp-ps5-exploit-server/releases). One way to flash the `.bin` file to your ESP8266 board is by using the [NodeMCU PyFlasher](https://github.com/marcelstoer/nodemcu-pyflasher).

## Configuration and Customization

### Changing SSID and Password

To customize the WiFi access point, modify `ServerConfig::ssid` and `ServerConfig::password` in `config.h` file.

### Changing Payloads

`bypervisor` and `elfldr` payloads are preloaded. You can change the additional payloads in `/data/payloads` folder. You will also need to manually update the contents of `/data/cache.appcache` file and `/data/payload_map.js` file.

Only `.elf` and `.bin` payload formats are currently supported.

### Flashing `.ino` File

To manually flash the `.ino` file after customization, you can use [Arduino IDE 1.x](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) and the [Arduino ESP8266 Filesystem Uploader](https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin). It is recommended to select the **Flash Size: "4MB (FS: 3MB OTA: ~512KB)"** option in the **Tools** tab in order to have ~2.5MB available for payloads.

**Note:** To continue redirecting **User's Guide** to the exploit page after flashing the `.ino` file, valid self-signed TLS certificate `ServerConfig::cert` and private key `ServerConfig::key` should be provided in `config.h` file. For instance, you could use the certificate and key from [frwololo's PS4_PS5-ESP8266-Server project](https://github.com/frwololo/PS4_PS5-ESP8266-Server).

## Credits

This project uses PROGMEM to store exploit files and necessary payloads, preserving SPIFFS for additional payloads. This approach was inspired by [stooged's PS5-Server project](https://github.com/stooged/PS5-Server) and [0x1iii1ii's fork](https://github.com/0x1iii1ii/PS5-Server/).
